All assignments (3) will be about the development of different parts of a project. Thus, every assignment will build upon code developed in the previous assignments. You are expected to work in teams of 5 for every assignment. 
Problem Statment
The specific project for this semester consists in building a simple “Risk” computer game. The developed program will have to be compatible with the rules and map files and the command-line play of the “Warzone” version of Risk, which can be found at: https://www.warzone.com/. A Warzone game setup consists of a connected graph map representing a world map, where each node is a territory and each edge represents adjacency between territories. Two or more players can play by placing armies on territories they own, from which they can attack adjacent territories to conquer them. The objective of the game is to conquer all territories on the map
